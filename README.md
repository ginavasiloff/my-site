# Hello!

This is my personal website, built in with Nextjs.

## Working With This Codebase

### :construction_worker: Development

`npm run dev` will start this site in development mode on http://localhost:3000

`npm run storybook` will start a Storybook instance at http://localhost:6006/

### :white_check_mark: Testing

`npm run test` will run all tests. Test files exist alongside the files containing the code being tested.

Tests will automatically run when a commit is made. The tests are not currently run as part of the deployment pipeline. :hushed:

### :link: Deployment

If you were able to push to the main branch at https://github.com/ginavasiloff/my-site, the code would be built and deployed to https://www.ginavasiloff.codes/.
